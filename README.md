A small personal project, this app integrates with fitbit to collect data about user's daily step count.  
The app dashboard displays user's step accumulated over the current month. User can compare their monthly stats    
with long distances, such as the city of Chicago or the diameter of the Earth, to put their physical activity level in a new perspective.
